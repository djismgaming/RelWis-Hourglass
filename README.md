# RelWis-Hourglass
Extract information from Hourglass data

At the moment:

It's best to do it from a terminal and launch terminal.php. From there, type HELP to get a list of commands to run.

Typically, do in order:

IMPORT
REPORT
TOTALS
QUIT

This will import the file hourglass-export.json into the DB, create a CSV that can be manually adjusted for presentation and finally dump to the screen the running pioneer hour totals.
